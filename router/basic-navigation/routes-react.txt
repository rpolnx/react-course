=== Remember ===

-> BrowserRoute to define the routes
-> Route to define the path to go to
-> Link to switch where to, but without reload all pages


Relative paths:

<Link to={{
    pathname: this.props.match.url + 'new-post', //this will be relative path
    hash: '#submit',
    search: '?quick-submit=true'
}}> New Post </Link>
